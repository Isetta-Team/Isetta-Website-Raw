# Welcome to Isetta Engine

We are a student project from Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center.  
Our aim is to demystify the game engine development process for ourselves and other novice engine developers.

## New here?
- We are making a game engine called Isetta to learn about game engine development. The Isetta engine is open-sourced [here](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine).
- We are documenting our whole process and recording all our discussions and decisions (even the bad ones) in weekly blogs starting from [Week 0](blogs/week-0/).
- We are interviewing industry professionals to help learn what we don't know don't know. Then we are sharing an edited, "concise" version of the talk [here](interviews/TommyRefenes-interview/).

## Where are we now?
- The latest changes for week # are available on github [here](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine/releases/tag/week-4).
- This past weeks blog, title [Buried in Comments](blogs/week-4/), talks about how we spent nearly a week to comment our code then invalidate them from code iteration.
- We recently interviewed with Tommy Refenes of Team Meat! See what he has to say about compartmentalizing your engine in [The Engine Sandwich](interviews/TommyRefenes-interview/).
- For a quick glance at progress, here is our engine architecture and what we think we have completed so far.
