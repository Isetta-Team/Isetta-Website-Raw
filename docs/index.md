# Welcome to Isetta Engine

We built a game engine in 3 months. Is that crazy? We've been told so. But there's no way to learn like being pushed straight into the deep end!

We are a student project from Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center.  The aim of the project is to help demystify the game engine development process for ourselves and any other novice developers who have interest in engine development but like us were too intimidated of where to start.

## New here?
- We made a game engine! It's called the Isetta Engine, and we did it to learn about game engine development. The Isetta Engine is [open-sourced here for anyone to see and criticize](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine)!
- We documented our whole development process and compiled what we learned on this website. The best place to look for [something specific about engine development is our compendium](compendium/index/).
- If you want to read our week-by-week progress, you can [start at Week 0](blogs/week-0/) in our weekly blog.
- We interviewed industry professionals as part of the project, and you can find [all of those interviews publically hosted on our website](interviews/index/)! We also have a [book published](http://www.lulu.com/shop/caleb-biasco-and-jared-ettinger-and-jacob-wilson-and-chaojie-zhu/behind-the-black-box-sessions-with-game-engine-professionals/paperback/product-23880229.html), if you're interested in getting a physical or PDF version of these interviews.
- If you're interested in using our engine (we appreciate your curiosity!), you can find our [starter documentation on our website](engine_docs/home/) as well.
