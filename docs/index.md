# Welcome to Isetta Engine

We are making a game engine and documenting the process.

## Mission Statement

The Isetta Engine is a student-driven project about demystifying game engine development and providing a roadmap and relevant knowledge for novice developers. To do so, our team will make a game engine by ourselves starting from a collection of base frameworks, and document the process, pitfalls, and advice for our audience with weekly blogs. Besides that, we will conduct interviews with experienced professionals to augment our novice perspective. We believe the novice perspective from our blogs and expert perspective from the interviews will nicely come together and form a complete document to help people get started. This project will span from August to December and all of our progress and code will be accessible via the [git repo](https://github.com/The-Engine-Process/The-Engine).

## Disclaimer

Although the project is aimed at helping novice developers, this is not to be used as a sole source of learning engine development. Being new engine developers ourselves, we can't guarantee the way we develop the engine will be correct, which is why interviews will help the project remain grounded. This means others who are learning can use what we've done as a guide and not necessarily the ground truth. The blogs won't be a walkthrough/tutorial/step-by-step instructions on how to develop an engine.

This also isn't a project about learning C++, programming patterns (although we will be using them), or design principles (which we will try to adhere to). From our understanding engine development can be messy, and although we will try to do our best, we have limited time to develop so we will comment, test, and design as much as we can without losing sight of the goal.
