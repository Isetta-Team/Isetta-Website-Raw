# Interview with Casey Muratori

On Saturday, September 8th, we interviewed Casey Muratori of [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) about developing a game engine as a solo developer and topics related to his series.

You can watch a recording of the interview on [Casey's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-h6TPkQ6ko&t=10s), and we are currently at work on a more concise edited version to post on our site. 

Our next planned interview is with Tommy Refenes, engine developer for [Super Meat Boy](https://supermeatboy.com/). You can expect to hear more about that later this month.
