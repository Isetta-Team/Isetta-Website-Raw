# Interviewing the Professionals

Here you will find interviews with industry professionals about game engine development. The topics of conversation run the gamut from low-level systems like memory management to abstraction to high level gameplay. Each interview was transcribed and edited to help with digestability and readability, and they also became more searchable as a result. Within the [compendium](../compendium/introduction.md), the interviews are grouped by subjectâ€”however, most of them have overlap with most topics, so you may end up reading them all!

If you are more of a physical person you can purchase a published version of the interviews in book format, [here](http://www.lulu.com/shop/caleb-biasco-and-jared-ettinger-and-jacob-wilson-and-chaojie-zhu/behind-the-black-box-sessions-with-game-engine-professionals/paperback/product-23880229.html). The price is $3, which is basically to cover printing cost.
