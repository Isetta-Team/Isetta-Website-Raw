# FAQ

// TODO Paragraph about purpose

1. What is the point of this project?
2. What platforms are you targeting?
3. Are you building everything from scratch?
4. Are you going to build an abstraction layer on top of the low level APIs?
5. What does the Horde3D engine provide?
    1. Horde3D is only a rendering engine.
6. Will this be paid for or free or open source?
    1. Open source all the way! We want as many others to benefit from our experience as possible. We are particularly targeting people who don't have the resource at their school like us.
7. Is your architecture the best/ideal architecture?
    1. No, probably not. We are novices so any decision we make may be right, may be wrong, we will probably know better at the end of the journey. We think going through the process of developing an engine, even if the architecture isn't the best, is worthwhile and worth following.
8. Will this be the definitive Twin-Stick Shooter engine?
    1. Nope, definitely not. We don't expect others to use this engine to develop any game (we probably wouldn't). It will be a janky engine, that will run a game, and we will learn a lot from.
