# Collisions

## Week 7
- [Intersection Testing](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-7/#collisions): Collision system is taking form, and the most basic intersection tests have been implemented, but there is still a lot of work to be done.

## Week 8
- [Handle Collision Events](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-8/#collisions): Third week working with collisions and things seem to be wrapping up, main focus was on how to handle collision events when one occurs.

## Week 9
- [Dynamic AABB Tree](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-9/#collisions-dynamic-aabb-tree): Finally got to work on optimizing the collision tree, and the speed up on the detection was better than expected!

## Week 11
- [Collision Solving](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-11/#collision-solving): Implemented rudimentary collision solving, but still have lots of distance to cover for a decent collision response system.
