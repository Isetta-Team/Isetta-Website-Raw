# 3rd Party
 
## Week 1
- [Rendering](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-1/#rendering): Chose Horde3D over Ogre and made a demo of it
- [Audio](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-1/#audio): Chose FMOD over OpenAL Soft, integrated it into our engine, and made a wrapper on it

## Week 2
- [Graphics](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-2/#graphics): Wrapped Horde3D as RenderModule and GLFW as WindowModule and improved inter-module communication model

## Week 3

## Week 5
- [GUI](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-5/#gui): Created a module for the GUI system, and learned why having a sample game is important for engine development.
- [More on Horde3D](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-5/#more-on-horde3d): Fixed the issues that Horde3D's lightweight-ness brought back to us.

## Week 10
- [Graphics](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-10/#graphics): Added in functionality to the texture class, so it now does more than just loading and can actually be used!

## Week 11
