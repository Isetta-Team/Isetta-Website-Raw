## Week 6
- [DLL](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-6/#dll): The engine was built into a DLL (well, sort of), and we were able to run the engine in another project.

## Week 11
- [Asset Processing Tool](https://isetta.io/blogs/week-11/#asset-processing-tool): Built an asset processing tool to process the Collada files (.dae) more efficiently, easier than in the past.
