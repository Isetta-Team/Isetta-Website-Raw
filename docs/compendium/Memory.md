# Memory

## Timeline

### Week 2
- [Memory Management, Part 1](../../blogs/week-2/#memory): We designed and implemented our initial naive version of [stack](../../blogs/week-2/#stack-allocator) and [pool](../../blogs/week-2/#pool-allocator) allocators, whose performance was proven to be phenomenal through [benchmarking](../../blogs/week-2/#benchmarking). We also [proposed a memory management pattern](../../blogs/week-2/#proposed-memory-management-patterns-in-our-engine) in our game, without knowing how big a boon or bane it would be in the future.

### Week 3
- [Memory Management, Part 2](../../blogs/week-3/#memory-management): We implemented a [double-buffer allocator](../../blogs/week-3/#double-buffered-allocator), a [pool allocator](../../blogs/week-3/#non-templated-pool-allocator), and our very first version of defragmentation with [custom object handles](../../blogs/week-3/#object-handles) instead of regular pointers.

### Week 4
- [Memory Defragmentation](../../blogs/week-4/#memory): A naive and unoptimized defragmentation system was born.

### Week 5
- [Memory Management, Part 3](../../blogs/week-5/#memory): Our previous allocators weren't enough for our needs, so we implemented an almighty [free list allocator](../../blogs/week-5/#freedom-from-the-free-list-allocator) that enabled a lot of versatility in our memory management systems. Unfortunately, this is effectively dynamic allocation, so we had to abandon our dream of [solely static allocations in the engine](../../blogs/week-5/#abandoning-the-all-static-fantasy). Our API [was changed](../../blogs/week-5/#abandoning-the-all-static-fantasy) after all of this to improve usability for our developers.

### Week 7
- Patch Notes:
	- [Free List Alignment Fix](../../blogs/week-7/#freelistallocator-alignment): We found an alignment bug in our freelist and fixed itâ€”temporarily. We [really fixed it](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine/commit/d7d24af304d58f763679bf65ffb3475dcb27d487#diff-5f55751c1c29a1bbebb54046753a0f79) a week or two later by changing the execution order of when we access a node on the free list and when we overwrite it.

### Week 10
- [Our Own Dynamic Array](../../blogs/week-10/#custom-dynamic-array): We used `std::vector` extensively in our engine and discovered the need for managing its memory, so we implmented our own dynamic array class. The process revealed more problems in our memory management system, which includes:
	- [A draw back to preallocating all of our memory](../../blogs/week-10/#a-drawback-to-preallocating-all-your-memory), which caused us to miss when we would make out-of-array accesses.
	- [Our memory management can only be used after a certain point in our initialization sequence](../../blogs/week-10/#initialization-timing-and-memory-management), so we needed to weigh some architecture decisions in order to use `static` variables.
	- [Placement `new` for array is undefined](../../blogs/week-10/#placement-new-for-arrays-is-undefined), and we had no clue. This one wasn't on us, but we did need to account for it by iterating over all of our allocated elements individually and initializing them instead of using array `new`.

### Week 12
- [Memory Management, Initialization Edition](../../blogs/week-12/#memory-manager-upgrades): Our free list allocator had been useful so far, but we kept hitting a problem whenever we would use more than we allotted at startup. So we implemented some allocator expansion features! And since our memory manager isn't a module within our engine, we refactored it to follow [RAII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii).
- [Performance Optimization](../../blogs/week-12/#performance-optimization): Some of our systems heavily used our free list allocator but could have been using our pool allocators, so we switched them over and saw some modest performance increases.
  
### Week 13
- [Monitoring Memory Leaks](../../blogs/week-13/#monitoring-memory-leaks): At long last, we implemented a system that can monitor leaks on our own memory manager.
