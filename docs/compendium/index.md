# What is a "Compendium"?

A compendium is a collection of concise but detailed information about a particular subject, like a comprehensive summary. For example, the encyclopedia can be referred to as a compendium of all human knowledge.
The Isetta Compendium is composed of all of our different domains of work, ranging from our Core systems all the way up through our high-level Gameplay systems. It includes the information covered in each of our weekly blogs for these domains, all of the relevant interviewee discussions related to the domain, and a postmortem from the team where we look back on our work and talk about our key learnings.

If you're interested in a particular subsystem, and especially if you're hoping to implement that system yourself, then this compendium may be useful to you. This section also serves as an index into the rest of our website's content depending on the engine subsystem.
