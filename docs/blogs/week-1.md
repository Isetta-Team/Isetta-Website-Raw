# The Building Blocks

It's hard to believe we technically started less than two weeks ago! During the summer, we pored over planning what the project would include, approximating how much we could accomplish in 3 months and preparing ourselves by reading relative materials. This week we started making decisions on our engine (we have a [separate blog](engine-architecture.md) on this!) and actual development. Before full-on diving into programming, we set up three systems not directly related to our engine but can ease our development process.

First, we set up the version control system with GitHub. We recommend you use version control in engine development just as you would with any kind of programming project. It preserves the project's history (so you can do crazy experiments without worrying about destroying your project!) and allows a team to work simultaneously on the same project together. We have broken our repository into development and feature branches, where each feature branch correspond to one "block" in our architecture diagram (as seen below).

Second, we set up the Google Linter [^1] to ensure the coding style amongst the four programmers remain consistent. A number of professionals we spoke to told us that coding styles can cause arguments between programmers and thus slow down the project. To nip this in the bud, we decided to use an automated system and always default to what was established in the linter, rather than personal opinion. This would give us a consistent code base that someone, such as yourself, may be able to follow. Although we will do our best to follow best practices, we can't guarantee we will. We are more focused on developing our own engine than software engineering as a whole. 

On this note, we will be trying to develop systems as they would in an engine, but there is no guarantee it will be correctâ€”in fact, it most likely won't be. We will be pulling from our knowledge of the _Game Engine Architecture_ book, since it is a book we have all read; however, we are writing about the topics from our understanding. We believe it is the journey of us talking about the topics, not necessarily the right decisions, which can be beneficial to you.

[^1]: A linter is a tool that flags code for errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

Finally, we set up a unit testing framework. This won't be used by the engine but we see it as a valuable system that can prevent code regression as we add new features. However, as with the coding standards, testing in general can subtract a large chunk of development time. So we are only doing light testing on public functions rather than the more lengthy full-coverage. If you have the time, we suggest you do full-coverage testing for your own engine.


## Roadmap

We have broken our architecture into 3 deadlines, over the next 3 months. 

The first deadline is September 24, where the base layer, the memory layer, tools, and our imported modules will be completed. The base layer is the groundwork of the engine and thus must be completed because the other systems rely on at least one of these systems in one way or another. The memory layer is the base for all modules, and needs to be done well because of the strong reliance on it. Doing it early allows us the opportunity to struggle through it as well as ample time to optimize. The tools will also be used throughout the rest of the engine which is why it is important to get them ready early. The imported modules are good to bring in early because it ensures that they work (which gives time in the case they don't) and can be a spike in motivation/confidence. Finally, starting the networking as soon as possible is something that we have been advised to do by many because it is integrated deeply with most systems.

The next deadline is October 22, where the utility layer, module layer, and networking will be completed. Networking is the biggest chunk of this roadmap phase because it's the largest unknown to us in our engine, and we want to prepare accordingly. The other systems being developed are in line with the future systems depending on them to function.

The final deadline is November 26, when we'll enter the feature lock phase. During the weeks following, we will be polishing the code as well as completing the game being built alongside the engine. The gameplay systems are in the highest layer of our engine, which is why it can be held off until the end, and the build portions of our architecture will be focused on at this point. Asset processing and caching can be held off until the end because they are features which convert final assets into playable assets of the final build of the game for better performance.

# Development

Based on our progress at the end of the first full week, we can what our team's four programmers accomplish would take 3-4 weeks for a single developer. It can be found on the [github repo](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine/tree/week-1) tagged with week-1.

## Version Control

We chose Github as our version control platform as we are open sourcing the game engine and hosting a website with all the documents along with the engine.

We also established a workflow to help us collaborate effectively. We decided to open a new branch for each feature and only merge it back to the "trunk" when finished, because a game engine is really a feature-heavy product. This strategy enables us to work on multiple features at a time without interfering with each other. The common use case is like this:

## Rendering

From our research, we narrowed our candidate libraries down to two: one is [Ogre](https://www.ogre3d.org/) and the other one is [Horde3D](http://horde3d.org/). Ogre is a powerful and flexible 3D graphics engine. It has a long history and is well known in the game industry for a while. In _Game Engine Architecture_, Jason Gregory described it as a well-architected, easy-to-learn and easy-to-use 3D rendering engine. Horde3D, relatively, is a younger 3D rendering engine, which just released its first stable release last year (2017). 

Choosing between these two libraries was hard. Both are well-designed, well-implemented, and can bring good visual capacity to the game engine. Thus, we thought about it more from our project's perspective:



*   Importing the rendering library is supposed to simplify our workload. **Building the library should be easy, the documentation should be clear, and the interface should be easy to use.**
*   We are not building a game engine around the rendering library, but using the rendering library as a replaceable module. We would like the rendering library to fit in our engine design. **The library should be lightweight, flexible and ideally ECS[^2]-friendly**

With the criteria above, we went through the building process and made simple demos with both libraries. For Ogre, we used Ogre 2.1 instead of the popular Ogre 1.x because Ogre 2.x fixed the architecture and performance issues pointed out by Mike Acton[^3].

After some experiments, we decided to use Horde3D as our rendering library. We don't think that Ogre is a bad library (its popularity disproves that!), but we believe that Horde3D fits better with the game engine itself for the following reasons:



*   **Building Horde3D is much easier than building Ogre 2.1.** The build process of Horde3D is so friendly that with one single click in CMake, we can have both GLFW (its dependency library) and Horde3D built. For Ogre, we need to download the dependency and core library from separate repos and build each of them separately. We also had to set the optimization of some components to /Od level (optimization disabled) to make it build successfully! Also, the official documentation for getting started was unclear and provides two sets of non-identical instructions in two different places.
*   **Horde3D is more lightweight and designed as components.** Ogre 2.1 has already encapsulated the rendering APIs into GameState and RenderSystem. To integrate it into our game engine, we will have to derive our solution from there. Instead, Horde3D only provides a small set of procedure interfaces, which allows us to implement the wrapper module by ourselves.

In the first week, we made a simple wrapper around the Horde3D as a proof-of-concept (see the HordeDemo folder). We will finish the wrapper as a module in the upcoming week.

[^2]: Entity-component-system (ECS) is an architectural pattern that follows composition over inheritance principle and is mostly used in games.

## Audio

With the requirements listed in our [architecture blog](engine-architecture.md/#audio) (a library which allows us to allocate the used memory ourselves and is widely used in the game industry) we started our research and found two strong candidates: OpenAL Soft and FMOD.

OpenAL caught our eyes first because it seemed related to OpenGL (it's not, but they do have other things in common), and we found an open source implementation of the standard named [OpenAL Soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft). On the other hand, we had heard of FMOD because Unity uses it on several platforms, and we think it's a good candidate purely from the [huge list of games](https://www.fmod.com/games) (with some hit titles) that use it.

We chose to give OpenAL Soft a try first because it's open source, while FMOD is owned by a commercial company and is not free (however, it does provide a free license for indie games with a budget under 500k). However, the team member who was assigned the task failed to get anything working in 3 hours, by the end of which he was still confused and stuck. This is partially due to the lack of Getting Started documentation and tutorials online, and partially because he is not experienced with audio APIs at all.

Then we decided to experiment with FMOD. It turns out that FMOD's low-level API is surprisingly easy to integrate and use, and has a [comprehensive documentation](https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-api). We were able to get the library integrated and play our first audio clip in 2 hours, with the help of some Getting Started tutorials [^4]. We think that, for novice engine programmers, these kind of tutorials are invaluable. They are a great way to introduce you to a new field and get you up and running quickly. Also, thanks to the FMOD documentation, we easily found the way to control its memory usage with [`Memory_Initialize()`](https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?page=content/generated/FMOD_Memory_Initialize.html#/). FMOD also provides a [tutorial](https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?page=content/generated/overview/memorysaving.html#/) on managing its memory!

After stitching the FMOD API into our project, we continued using it to create a minimal audio engine. It takes care of loading sound files, managing loaded sound assets (with the help of [string-id](engine-architecture.md/#core)), playing sound, managing a sound's play mode, managing a sound's lifetime with pause/continue/stop, and prevent memory leaks. You can take a look at the source code: [`Audio.h`](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine/blob/code-review/Isetta/Isetta/Core/Audio/Audio.h), [`Audio.cpp`](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/Isetta-Engine/blob/code-review/Isetta/Isetta/Core/Audio/Audio.cpp)

[^4]: We referred to two tutorials by Cody Claborn when integrating FMOD API. [Setting Up Xcode and Visual Studio for FMOD Development](https://codyclaborn.me/tutorials/setting-up-xcode-and-visual-studio-for-fmod-development/) and [Making a Basic FMOD Audio Engine in C++](https://codyclaborn.me/tutorials/making-a-basic-fmod-audio-engine-in-c/)


## Networking

Our original plan for running low-level networking sockets was to use [Valve's GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets) because of the feature set it lists, which we hoped is extensive enough for us to avoid pitfalls in network programming. Other options were either too flimsy or too low-level, and since none of us have game networking experience, we want the most straightforward option possible.

At the time of writing this, the GameNetworkingSockets library is a pretty big pain to build, involving several installs and build steps. One of us even took a couple of days automating the build process, and it's still not 100% consistent! Beyond this, the resulting API seems to cover our engine's use case, which is as minor as we can possibly make it without removing networking entirely. Unfortunately, the codebase is still heavily in clean-up mode, and that makes it less accessible for integrating our own allocators and APIs with it. Not to mention that very little exists for documentation.

![Networking](../images/blogs/game_networking_sockets_test.png "Successful Build of GameNetworkingSockets")

Recently, we found another heavily featured networking library named [yojimbo](https://github.com/networkprotocol/yojimbo), built by [Glenn Fiedler](https://gafferongames.com/) of game network programming fame. This library appears to be more ready for integrating into our own engine, albeit with equally as poor documentation (there's a bit of Doxygen to use, I guess). One big plus to this library is that it's not riddled with commented-out code like the GameNetworkingSockets one is at the time of this writing, which makes us lean more toward yojimbo.

We've yet to determine the fate of networking in our engine, so you'll likely hear more on that progress from us next time.


## Profiler

For the profiler, we imported [Brofiler](http://brofiler.com/), a C++ game profiler developed by Vadim Slyusarev. We picked Brofiler because is it is a lightweight and made specifically for games (not software in general) and has an easy-to-read UI. The library is open-source and relatively easy to integrate, although it's a bit outdated and requires some rework for our project. To help keep followers of our work from reworking the profiler with their own engine, we created a fork of the original Brofiler repo with the necessary changes to get it running. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Isetta-Team/brofiler) and will likely make integration in your engine easier!

The Brofiler tool has also been used on the game _Skyforge_ and has been integrated into CryEngine, although CryEngine creates a wrapper around Brofiler. With more time, we would do the same, but it doesn't seem necessary for basic usage. Examples and the original repo can be found on the [Brofiler github](https://github.com/bombomby/brofiler).
